              <p>
                Why get a refund if you can suggest changes to the artist?

                We recommend you suggest Photoshop or Painting revisions as we do not charge for them, and you have Unlimited Revisions available with you.
                One of the major reasons we dont want you to directly go for a refund and ask the artist to make changes is that our artists have to bear a certain percentage of the painting price if you take a refund. As a company, we try our best to deliver smiles to the Customers and our Artist Team; we hope you understand.
                If you dont like the artwork even after multiple revisions, feel free to place a refund request, we owe a refund to you!
